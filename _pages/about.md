My areas of research are Combinatorics, Geometry and Topology.  Specifically, my research interest is in Topological and Geometric Graph Theory, and Discrete and Computational Geometry.

Topology  and  Geometry  have  played  a  key  role  in  the  study  of  combinatorial  structures, such as Graphs. Graphs, known as networks in applied science, are widely used to visually represent information ranging from genetics and biochemical pathways to subway maps and socialnetworks.  The quest for finding efficient algorithms to obtain good graph visualizations have raised many new questions in the mathematical study of graph drawings.  I am specially motivated to explore how the combinatorial, geometric and topological methods can be applied to find better graph drawings.
