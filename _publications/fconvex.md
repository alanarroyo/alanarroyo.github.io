There are three main thrusts to this article: a new proof of Leviâ€™s Enlargement
Lemma for pseudoline arrangements in the real projective plane; a new characterization of pseudolinear drawings of the complete graph; and proofs that pseudolinear
and convex drawings of $$K_n$ have $$n^2+O(n\log n)$$ and $$O(n)$$, respectively, empty
triangles. All the arguments are elementary, algorithmic, and self-contained.
