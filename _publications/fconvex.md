excerpt: 'A {\em good drawing\/} of $K_n$ is a drawing of the complete graph with $n$ vertices in the sphere such that: no two edges with a common end cross; no two edges cross more than once; and no three edges all cross at the same point. Gioan's Theorem asserts that any two good drawings of Kn that have the same rotations of incident edges at every vertex are equivalent up to Reidemeister moves. At the time of preparation, 10 years had passed between the statement in the WG 2005 conference proceedings and our interest in the proposition. Shortly after we completed our preprint, Gioan independently completed a preprint.'

A pseudoline is a homeomorphic image of the real line in the plane so that its complement is disconnected. An arrangement of pseudolines is a set of pseudolines in which every two cross exactly once. A drawing of a graph is pseudolinear if the edges can be extended to an arrangement of pseudolines. In the recent study of crossing numbers, pseudolinear drawings have played an important role as they are a natural combinatorial extension of rectilinear drawings. A characterization of the pseudolinear drawings of Kn was found recently. We extend this characterization to all graphs, by describing the set of minimal forbidden subdrawings for pseudolinear drawings. Our characterization also leads to a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize pseudolinear drawings and construct the pseudolines when it is possible.
