Our main result includes the following, slightly surprising, fact: a $$4$$‐connected nonplanar graph $$G$$ has crossing number at least 2 if and only if, for every pair $$\{e,f\}$$ of edges having no common incident vertex, there are vertex‐disjoint cycles in $$G$$ with one containing $$e$$ and the other containing $$f$$.
