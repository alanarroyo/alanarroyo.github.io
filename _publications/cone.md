Motivated by a problem asked by Richter and by the long standing Harary--Hill conjecture, 
we study the relation between the crossing number of a graph $$G$$ and the crossing number of its cone $$CG$$,
the graph obtained from $$G$$ by adding a new vertex adjacent to all the vertices in $$G$$.
Simple examples show that the difference $cr(CG)-cr(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for any fixed $$k=cr(G)$$.
In this work, we are interested in finding the smallest possible difference; that is, for each nonnegative integer $$k$$, 
find the smallest $$f(k)$$ for which there exists a graph with crossing number at least $$k$$ and cone with crossing number
$$f(k)$$. For small values of $$k$$, we give exact values of $$f(k)$$ when the problem is restricted to simple graphs and 
show that $$f(k)=k+\Theta (\sqrt {k})$$ when multiple edges are allowed.
